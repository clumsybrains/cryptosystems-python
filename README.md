# Classical Cryptosystems
Encryption and Decryption for popular classical ciphers in python.

## Shift Ciphers
All the alphabets are shifted by any number mod 26 during encryption.
The text is shifted back for decryption.
This gives 26 possibilities for encryption, including the plaintext.

### Caesar Cipher
This is shift cipher with shift as 4.

### ROT13
This is shift cipher with shift 13. Here encryption and decryption algorithms are same.

### ROT47
This is for ACII values from ! (33) till ~ (126). Total 94 values. Here also encryption and decryption algorithms are same.
